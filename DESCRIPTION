Description:
  Interfaces to R functions that are 'non-pipe-aware',
  such as 'lm', so they can be included in data
  science pipelines, implemented by 'magrittr'
  with the operator %>%, without having to rely on
  workarounds of varying complexity. In addition, three
  extensions for pipelines, called 'intubOrders',
  'intuEnv', and 'intuBags', are implemented.
