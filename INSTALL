  intubate has been developed on a Gentoo 64 bits Linux platform. 32 bits
  systems should not make any difference. It should work in other *nix
  variants, including OS X.

  Binary packages for Windows, both 32 and 64 bits, have been
  successfully built in winbuilder (http://win-builder.r-project.org).

  If you want to install intubate in Windows from source, you may need to
  have a recent version of Rtools installed.
