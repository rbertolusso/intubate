        * Interfaces to more CRAN packages ("e1071", "gbm",
          "randomForest", "tree").

        * Functions with formula followed by data now are
          in two groups: one in which the reversal of
          parameters is necessary (and this is associated
          to the helper function ntbt_function_formula_data),
          and another in which it is not.

        * Added vignette.

        * C stack error on definition #1 (barryrowlingson)
          Fixed potential bug if user creates an interface
          function non starting with ntbt_.

        * Feature request: support for lfe::felm #3 (kendonB)
          Interface to "felm" in "lfe"is there now.

        * ntbt_function_* functions fail if you use :: #5 (richierocks)
          Fixed.
